# Bugs

There's a huge number of bugs in the site intentionally left with bugs. Documenting each of them clearly and concisely feels like a multi-hour task all on its own! In light of this, I've instead chosen to track what I perceive to be issues with the production website within this document.

I've approached my bug-hunting from a black-box perspective rather than allowing myself access to review the source code of the website under test (which I'd usually prefer to do).

| Issue | Description | Reproduction | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Slowness in responses, often to the point of HTTP timeout | The publicly hosted instance of the test website does not have reliable response times. During test development, response times varied from sub-second to over 30s (causing a browser timeout). | Use the website at a busy time. (Or DDoS the host- naughty.) | Host should be looking into client-side caching further. I can't much- if any- evidence of cache instruction in response headers. That's a bit weird given the data in the site should be more-or-less static. At very least, the data should be permitted to be static for an hour or so- that would hugely aid in reducing request spam. |
| Constant unnecessary calls to GET /me receiving 401 | The browser knows when a user is logged in by looking at its own cookies. But it doesn't check here before calling GET /me, which will always get 401. Not only is this generating unnecessary traffic, it would make telemetry review unnecessarily tricky. | Access any page whilst not logged in. | Implement front-end logic to conditionally call the API only when we're possibly going to get 2xx. |
| Accessibility issues | A quick check using web accessability evaulation tools shows a huge number of issues that cause WCAG non-compliance. | Use eg. WAVE browser extension on each page on site. | Follow recommendations from evaulation tools. |
| Un-responsive filtering/search UX | The way the pagination/filtering and search have been implemented rely on API calls rather than on-page js. This model helps when there are 1000s of products, but given the low number of products available this is a bit over-engineered. Whilst API calls for filtering/searching/changing page are in-flight, there's no update to the UX. If these API calls take a while to complete, the resultant UX is a bit janky. | Perform filter/search/change page on homepage. | Implement endpoints to retrieve a full list of products, without pagination. Call this, and then use on-page js. |
| UI uses packages with vulnerabilities | `npm audit` at the time I was working on the task shows that the project owners have been ignoring [this CVE](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-7mvr-c777-76hp) for a while. | `npm audit` | `npm audit fix` - updates are fairly minimal! :) |
| Running the API locally results in 500 responses | I pulled `main` and followed the readme instructions to instantiate a local development environment. All API calls from the UI receive a 500 without any detail. | Run UI locally | ?? - there's really not much information available here to help me debug. There's also currently no open issues on the repo. |
